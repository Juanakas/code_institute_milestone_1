# 1. UX

- The website welcomes users with a visually appealing header and a clear introduction to the purpose of the site: showcasing completed road cycling sportives.

- Navigation is simple and intuitive, with a fixed navigation bar at the top providing quick links to the Home section, the list of completed sportives, and the area with a click button to the Author's Facebook profile.

- The "Reasons to join us" section is prominently displayed, encouraging engagement and community participation.

- Each sportive is presented in a consistent, card-like section with a bold title, event details table, and a row of high-quality images, making it easy for users to browse and compare events.

- The use of alternating background colors for each sportive section helps users visually distinguish between different events.

- Responsive design ensures the site is fully usable and attractive on all devices, with tables, images, and text adapting smoothly to different screen sizes.

- Horizontal rules and spacing provide clear separation between sections, improving readability and reducing visual clutter.

- The footer offers a clear call to action for social engagement, with a direct link to the website creator's Facebook profile.

- All text is styled for clarity and accessibility, using high-contrast colors and readable fonts.

- The overall layout guides the user naturally from the introduction, through the reasons to join, to the list of events, and finally to the contact information, creating a logical and user-friendly flow.

# 2. HTML Structure Overview

The `index.html` file is the main page of the Road Cycling Sportives website. It is organized to provide a clear, responsive, and visually appealing presentation of cycling events. Here is an overview of its structure:

- **DOCTYPE and Head**: The file begins with the HTML5 doctype and includes meta tags for character set, viewport, description, keywords, and author. The page links to the main stylesheet (`styles_2.css`) and sets the page title.

- **Body and Main Content**: All visible content is wrapped in a `<div class="main-content">` to control horizontal alignment and spacing.

- **Header**: The `<header class="page-header">` contains the main site title and introductory text, styled with a background image and centered text.

- **Navigation**: The `<nav class="nav">` provides links to the home section, the list of completed sportives, and the footer section where there is a link to Juan's Facebook profile.

- **Reasons Section**: A visually distinct box (`.reasons-box`) highlights reasons to join the cycling group, using an ordered list for clarity.

- **Sportives Section**: The main content area (`<section id="sportives">`) lists all completed sportives. Each sportive is represented by a `.sportive` div containing:

  - An event title (`<h3>`)

  - A flex container (`.sportive-content`) with:

    - A details table (`.sportive-table`) listing date, location, organizer, distance, and completion time

    - A row of event images (`.sportive-images`)

  - Each sportive is separated by a horizontal rule for visual clarity.

- **Footer**: The `<footer class="site-footer">` appears at the bottom, providing a contact link (Facebook) and styled to match the site's color scheme.

- **Responsiveness**: The structure is designed to be fully responsive, with media queries in the CSS ensuring usability and readability on all devices.

# 5. Deployment

### Syncing the project to GitHub

I have added and synced my `03_PROJECT1` to GitHub from within VS Code, I followed these steps:

1. Open VS Code in the `03_PROJECT1` folder.

2. Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``) and initialize a Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Add all files to the repository and make the first commit:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository (`code_institute_milestone_1`). Do not initialize with a README, as I already have one.

5. Copy the repository URL provided by GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/Juanakas/code_institute_milestone_1.git`)

6. In the VS Code terminal, connect the local repository to GitHub:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/03_PROJECT1.git
   ```

7. Set the main branch and push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

*The project is now published on GitHub. I can use the Source Control panel in VS Code for future commits and pushes.*
